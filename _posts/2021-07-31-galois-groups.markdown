I am not sure what are Galois groups but I do know the existence of such groups in math community. In this post, I would like to share the least interesting part of learning and understanding the Galois groups and their properties.

### Definition Galois Groups

**Definition** *blablabla*

### Basic properties of Galois groups

1. Prop 1
2. Prop 2
    - sub 1
    - sub 2

### Example of galois groups

- GG1
- GG2
- GG3

Please refer to the [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_group)

Now that we know what Galois groups are, then we can take a break and enjoy a cup coffee! See you in the next post!
